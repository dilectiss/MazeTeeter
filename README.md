# MazeTeeter
This project is the final group assignment of COMP1140 "Advanced Computing" at the Australian National Unviersity in 2011. 
MazeTeeter is a simple game where the user directs a ball into the winning location through a restricted path, avoiding holes that are randomly generated on the path. The interactions of the objects (ball, wall) obey basic Newtonian laws.
